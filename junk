Web Application Development for Pharmaceutical Shipment Tracking:

Developed a web application for tracking pharmaceutical shipments, focusing on both front-end and back-end development. Utilized React.js for an interactive user interface, allowing users to create, manage, and delete scenarios, along with critical form validations for data integrity.

On the back end, implemented APIs using Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and Spring Data JPA for all CRUD operations. Ensured performance and scalability through error handling and optimized database queries.

Ikegai - KPMG Internal Project:

As a front-end developer, I designed interactive features to enhance application responsiveness, including a "Stop Response" button for user control and a prompt positioning feature for customizable layouts.

Addressed critical bugs, such as ensuring uninterrupted response generation and resolving document renaming issues. Improved user navigation by embedding external web pages and implementing a category filter for targeted searches.

Enhanced security with an auto logout feature and restricted access for unauthorized users. Additionally, I managed the deployment to Azure Web App and established a CI/CD pipeline for automated updates
